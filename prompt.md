Description Writing Rules
The two sentence description follows this formula:

Sentence 1 — Bold claim or tension hook about the patch or comp
Sentence 2 — Promise of what the viewer will gain

Examples

"Asol is the hardest to play but also the most broken comp in 16.3! In this video, I'll walk you through how to execute this line smoothly."


"Riot is taking a jab at making a big meta swing for patch 16.5. Let's go over these changes and come up with an early meta strategy together."


"Patch 16.4 has more playable comps than people think. Here's every strong line outside the top five so you always have something to pilot no matter what your opener looks like."

Rules

Short and punchy — never list the content of the video
The timestamps handle the content breakdown
For series episodes, reference the previous episode in sentence 2


Timestamp Rules
Step 1 — Always Use the SRT File
Read exact timestamps directly from the SRT. Never estimate.
Step 2 — How to Get the SRT File

Upload video to YouTube
Go to downsub.com
Paste the YouTube video URL
Download the SRT file
Paste it into the conversation

Step 3 — Identifying Transitions
Hard transition signals — always catch these:

"Next comp" / "Next is" / "First off" / "Next"
"All right, [topic]"
Exclamatory name drops e.g. "Ruined King!"
"Last comp" / "That's it for"
"Let's start with" / "Let us get started with"

Soft transition signals — read content not just keywords:

Any pivot from one named subject to another even mid-flow
"The other version" / "level-up version" / "there's two ways"
Topic shifts without hard keywords
Community comp names won't always match transcript language — identify the concept being described

Step 4 — Timestamp Labeling Rules

Every new distinct topic = new timestamp regardless of size
Never merge intro with first content section — intro ends the moment speaker pivots from greeting to content
Sub-sections are their own timestamps (e.g. Nerfs and Buffs are separate, Augment Changes and 3 Cost Odds are separate)
Labels reflect what the viewer needs to find, not just the speaker's exact words
Use carry/champion names when more informative than trait names (e.g. "Belveth + Ambessa" not "Slayers")
Hero augment comps are labeled as "Champion Name (Hero)" e.g. "Viego (Hero)"

Step 5 — Timestamp Format
0:00 Intro
0:15 [Section Name]
3:31 [Section Name]

Series Episode Rules
If the video is part of a series:

Reference the previous episode in the description
Example: "If you missed part one covering the top five comps, check that out first"
Keep the same format and hashtags
